      MANIT was started in 1960 as Maulana Azad College of Technology (MACT),
      named after the first Minister of Education of India, Maulana Abul Kalam
      Azad. MACT started functioning in 1960 at Govt S.V. Polytechnic with an
      intake of 120 students and seven faculty members. It was one of the first
      out of eight Regional Engineering Colleges started during the second
      five-year plan (1956-1960) in India, where the main focus was development
      of the public sector and rapid industrialisation. To ensure enough supply
      of trained personnel to meet the demand of rapid industrialisation, a
      decision was taken to start the Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), one
      in each major state of India to churn out graduates with good engineering
      merit. Thus a total of seventeen RECs were established 1959 onwards, one
      in each major state of India. Each college was a joint and cooperative
      enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government.
      MACT was one of the first eight REC's to be established in each region in
      India. It was established in the Western Region along with Visvesvaraya
      National Institute of Technology, Nagpur and Sardar Vallabhbhai National
      Institute of Technology, Surat.
